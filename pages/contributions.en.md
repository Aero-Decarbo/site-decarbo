AÉRO DÉCARBO willingly participates in the work carried out by other associations or organizations. The contribution generally involves technically conducting environmental impact analyses (mainly focusing on the energy-climate axis) in the field of aviation or aerospace.

                    The mission of AÉRO DÉCARBO is to shed light on reflections regarding the transition trajectories of the aerospace sector towards a world respectful of planetary boundaries, factually and, as much as possible, quantitatively. This is with the aim of highlighting the risks, the room for maneuver, and qualifying the potential decarbonization levers to define development trajectories compatible with climate and energy challenges. Thus, when Pour un Réveil Ecologique approached us on this project of a report on the space sector, AÉRO DÉCARBO willingly agreed to be a partner and contribute to instructing Part 2 of this report "The environmental impacts of the space sector".
                    <br><br>
                    AÉRO DÉCARBO, as an association, does not take a stance on the opinions or criticisms expressed towards the actors or projects cited throughout the report, particularly in the analysis of the various actors carried out by Pour un Réveil Écologique (Part 4). This choice of associative positioning does not presuppose the personal opinions of AÉRO DÉCARBO members, some of whom are also members of Pour un Réveil Ecologique.
                    <br><br>
                    Regardless of the opinions expressed in this report, we would like to commend this didactic approach undertaken by Pour un Réveil Ecologique. Through the initial chapters, this report is able to meet the expectations of readers, even novices, interested in the subject, both in terms of demonstrating the current effective realities of each space mission and their applications in our daily lives, as well as the organizations, challenges, and room for maneuver of the sector in favor of a decarbonized world.
                    <br><br>
                    The fight against climate change, as well as the mastery of all environmental and ecological challenges, remains a prerequisite for us for any human activity. Unfortunately, the space sector cannot be exempt from this, because although it provides extraordinary services to Earthlings and makes us dream beyond the very distant galaxies, we believe it cannot develop at the expense of a physical and ecological reality on our only habitable planet. If this report can contribute to raising awareness at all levels that action is needed, from businesses to citizens to governments, then it will have achieved its main objective, which we sincerely hope for! <a href=https://pour-un-reveil-ecologique.org/en/articles/rapport-secteur-spatial/  target="_blank">Access the repport</a>
