                Following the verdict announcement of the trial of Greenpeace activists who repainted an airplane green, we have come together to write this opinion piece calling on the aviation sector to seriously consider trajectories of reduced growth, primarily in its own interest. We assert that energy efficiency, the use of decarbonized energy, and frugality must complement each other, rather than oppose, in the dual objective of reducing emissions and building sector resilience in the face of climate change and dwindling fossil resources. <a href=https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2024/03/10/nous-appelons-airbus-safran-air-france-aeroports-de-paris-a-envisager-publiquement-une-reduction-du-trafic-aerien_6221196_3232.html target="_blank">Read the opinion piece (french)</a>

                In this article, 20 minutes interviewed us about the impact of human activities in the upper atmosphere. It's worth noting an ambiguous sentence suggesting that we align with the general discourse on the "Green Plane".

               At the occasion of the 2023 Paris Air Show, Le Monde published a series of opinion pieces on the topic of aviation. Here, we emphasize the importance of considering cumulative emissions in assessing the impact of aviation (as for any other sector) and its immediate consequence: emission reduction cannot wait until 2050; it must start as soon as possible to be more socially and economically acceptable while remaining within a carbon budget compatible with the Paris Agreement. Frugality in usage and technological progress are two levers that, rather than opposing each other, contribute to achieving the same goal. <a href=https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2023/07/14/impact-climatique-de-l-avion-la-technologie-n-est-qu-une-partie-de-la-reponse_6181971_3232.html#xtor=AL-32280270-%5Bdefault%5D-%5Bios%5D target="_blank">Read the opinion piece (french)</a>

                A program on the media coverage of aviation and its impact, on the occasion of the 2023 Paris Air Show and government announcements. The title of the program is a quote that does not come from AÉRO DÉCARBO.
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Arrêt sur images pitch:</strong> Politicians and aerospace companies promise: for sure, airplanes will be completely green and decarbonized within 25 years! The commitment is inspiring, repeatedly echoed in the media on the occasion of the reopening of the Paris Air Show. We would love to be able to travel to the other side of the world without feeling guilty about the thousands of liters of kerosene dumped. But rarely do decision-makers in the aviation sector and political leaders explain in detail how they plan to achieve this goal. Wasn't it Guillaume Faury himself, CEO of Airbus, who recently asserted on France Inter's morning show: "We will succeed in decarbonizing aviation, it's obvious!" The media enthusiasm surrounding aviation technological innovations deserves a closer look. What are these innovations worth in practice? What realities lie behind the talking points of a sector that is defending its credibility? And what about air traffic flows, which are rarely questioned? To answer these questions, three guests: Olivier Del Bucchia, aerospace engineer, co-founder of the Aero Decarbo association advocating for the ecological transition of the aerospace sector; Isabelle Laplace, Ph.D. in economics specializing in aerospace at the National School of Civil Aviation; and Éva Morel, member of the Quota Climat collective working for a better media treatment of ecological issues <a href=https://www.arretsurimages.net/emissions/arret-sur-images/secteur-aerien-lobjectif-nest-pas-de-decarboner-cest-de-croitre target="_blank">See the webcast (french)</a>

               At the occasion of the 2023 Paris Air Show, Brut. Nature reached out to us to shed light on the various technological avenues leading to the emergence of a 'green aircraft'.
               <br><br>
               <strong>Brut. pitch:</strong> 'Ultra-low-emission aircraft', 'green aircraft', 'hydrogen-powered aircraft' or 'cooking oil-powered aircraft'... We hear more and more about aircraft being touted as more environmentally friendly, and it can quickly become difficult to keep up. Concretely, where do these alternative aircraft stand? And are they sufficient to address the climate emergency? We wanted to gain clarity on this by interviewing Jeanne Bosc Bierne, contributor to the 'Flying in 2050' report. <a href=https://www.brut.media/us/nature/les-avions-propres-c-est-vraiment-pour-bientot--f4c2fc04-4ffb-4b07-84b0-22ff9e8aaac5 target="_blank">See the report (french)</a>
