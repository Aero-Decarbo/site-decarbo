        If you are a conscientious driver, this is not breaking news: a significant portion of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change, including the famous CO2 (carbon dioxide), comes from transportation and petrol engines.
        <br>This article aims to delve a little deeper into the understanding of the physical phenomena behind the necessary fuel consumption of our car. The intention is not to dictate what is right or wrong but to take a closer look at the cause-and-effect relationships involved in everyday car transportation, shedding light on the choices we are compelled to make in terms of fuel consumption.
        <br>To read this article, it will not be necessary to have an engineering degree or a Ph.D. in Physical Science, but it will be easier if you have the mindset of an investigator and the desire to delve into things. You should be familiar with the concepts of addition, multiplication, percentages, and not be too allergic to formulas 'with letters'. For these formulas and concepts, if you don't already know them, you'll either have to take our word for it or check them yourself, on Wikipedia or elsewhere, which we strongly encourage you to do. Of course, if you are already familiar with the concept of energy in the scientific sense of the term, you'll have a little head start.
        <br>That being said, given that the question of energy is at the heart of current climate and resource issues, one rarely wastes time reading and thinking about it.  <a href="/documents/201909_PetitePhysAuto.pdf" target="_blank">Read more (sorry it's in French, use your favorite translation AI if needed)...<</a>
